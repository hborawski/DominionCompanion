# Contributing to DominionCompanion

### Before a Pull Request

Before creating a pull request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/hborawski/DominionCompanion/issues) for discussion, and for tracking.



### Getting Started

##### Requirements:

- Xcode `12.4`+
- Ruby `2.7.2`+ (optional, for running fastlane, PR build will run build/test from fastlane)

### Expectations

- Code added should follow standard SwiftUI patterns
- Code added should not decrease code coverage.
  - If you need help understanding how to test, or how to write testable code, we can discuss it on the PR, or ahead of time on the associated issue
